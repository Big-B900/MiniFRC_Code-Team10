as of 2017/11/5:
Practice bot is somewhat upgraded
added more cables and code on the nano to improve servo
cheval and floor positions prob. not needed, just use joystick
then use the 3 free commands (those 2 plus 111) to command other servos
 - problem: wouldn't be able to control them simultaneously

since testing: changed around axis and button on defaultBot for commanding the arm 
so that it does axis last and will actually be able to do the other ones


todo program:
 - fix presets after testing, dial in values
 - remove useless prests
 - make killer autos
 - figure out how to control rear servos from nano
 - also figure out if lights are a thing
	- even button in gear mech to tell me when I've grabbed it and make ground effect lighting or something. 

todo mech
 - test robot and code
 - prototype porticullis mech 
	- servos?
	- spring/elastic
		- how to trigger: servo?
		- make sure won't hinder other things
 - prototype rails or cover
	- cover to prevent gears from staying in bot
 - prototype new climber and its location
	- test location with some sort of rig on practice bot. 
 - find and install ground effect lighting
	- for indicating having a gear
	- also figure out how to control it...
 - find button for gear mech to sense gear
	- to command lighting. 

todo cad
 - bring cad up to date with current robot and plan 
	- so it can be copied after start build and made slightly better. 
	- include rear portion with servos

 - CAD prototype rails and/or cover to prevent gears from falling
 	- printed
 - cad protype printed climber
	- new location
	- anchor on other side
	- prevent rope coming of
 - add panels on gear mech for cheval
 - add button on gear mech for gear identification?

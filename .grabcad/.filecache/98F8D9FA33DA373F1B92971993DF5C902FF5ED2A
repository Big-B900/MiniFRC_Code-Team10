FIGURE OUT HOW TO SEND WHICH AUTON
 - Idea: hack into DS so can send int for auton from 0 (nothing) to 26, etc. based on different keys...
 - ex: q is go forward 10s, w is low bar gear, e is gear from first pos w/ standard defence, d is gear + cheval from pos 1, c is gear + porticullis from pos 1...
 - a and z are just porticullis + cheval, no gear


defences most likely to get gear from programatically: 
 - Low bar
 - porticullis
 - less likely:
	 - rock wall
	 - moat
	 - rough terrain
